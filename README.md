# AutoLoadDATPlus
AutoLoadDATPlus is a QGIS plugin designed to streamline the process of importing .dat files containing spatial point data. It reads space-delimited files (often used in scientific and survey data), extracts coordinate and attribute fields, and adds them to the QGIS map canvas as point vector layers.
